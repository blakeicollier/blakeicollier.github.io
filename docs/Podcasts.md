I have left a long line of dead podcasts in my wake, most of which are nowhere to be found. (If you find them, please let me know). 

However, I am resurrecting one from obscurity currently over at Substack, but you can find it on all of your typical podcast apps. The TSOM panel (including myself) search far and wide for the worst music out there with the help of special guests and our own bad music magnetism. The podcast is celebrating its 10th anniversary starting this year. It truly is a worthy endeavor.

The other one is my current podcast which happens to also be my longest running one. My co-host Jamison Barsotti and I tangentially talk about films every week. We call it a low-effort, low-quality podcast. We also recently came up with our tagline: "This is the way the world ends, not with a bang but with two dinguses. This is, simply, good field recording." Join us for discussion about anything and everything and...eventually movies.
