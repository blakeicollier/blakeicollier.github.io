![Blake Collier](https://p.ipic.vip/akne0j.png)

Hi. If you can't tell already, my name is Blake I. Collier. (I include the "I." to sound distinguished, but in reality I am anything but that). I was born and raised in the flatlands and literal shitstorms of the Texas Panhandle. That land still lives inside of me and my heart belongs there even though I currently live in the so-called "Green Country" of Tulsa, Oklahoma. I have a wonderful wife who spends her life "keeping kids safe" as my oldest son always says. She also keeps adults safe as well. I have two boys who I call the "Sons of Thunder" due, in part, to their natures, but also due to the fact their their names are the Gaelic forms of James and John (check out Mark 3:17 if you aren't familiar with that nickname). I love them to death (and back).

I have a BA in history from The University of Texas at Arlington and a MA in history from Texas Tech University. I am currently using none of that background as I currently draw lines and an occasional circle for a living (i.e. draftsman). Outside of this, I have spent the last 10+ years writing about mostly horror film for various online publications. You can find a good selection of those linked articles on my [Curriculum Vitae](https://blakeicollier.github.io/curriculumvitae/). Somewhere around the COVID epoch I somewhat lost my taste for writing about films and shifted my attention to other matters driven by my own neurosis and my drift toward more traditional Marxist/socialist frameworks of thought. So these days you will find me writing more about technology, labor, the weird and the eerie often in relation to their first two subjects and the idea of place. 

I am an avid reader who is often in the middle of 2-3 books at a time. My wife asks me if what I am reading at any given moment is "homework" or not. I suppose it's all homework depending on what one wants to accomplish by the act of reading. More literally, her meaning is whether or not the book is a selection from the book club of which I am a part with some friends of mine. Nonetheless, my bookshelf is quite eclectic in its makeup. 

I am intending for this site to be my landing place. So I can point interested parties to my CV, link my various podcasts, and do some occasional blogging. I will be tinkering with the themes and code off and on as I learn more about HTML and Python (as a hobby) so don't be surprised if a link doesnt work or the look changes suddenly. Eventually I will get it to where I want it. 

Until then, I hope you will check in from time to time. My email is on the front page, so feel free to say hello.
