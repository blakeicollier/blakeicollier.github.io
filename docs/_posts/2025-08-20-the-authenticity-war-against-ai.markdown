My cohost Jamison Barsotti and I have been trading emails back and forth with a lady who does PR for various filmmakers. This lady randomly reached out to us to ask us if we wanted to interview this filmmaker who had released a praised documentary film some twenty years ago and was about to get a re-release. The first thought that naturally crossed our minds was this was a bot. _Fly By Films_ does not have a large listener base, it doesn't even have a small listener base. On last count, we have 5 or 6 people that listen regularly and all of them are people we know. We only have 17 follows on Spotify. This podcast has existed for 3+ years and we still have not reached 2,000 downloads/streams. It was a reasonable assumption for us to make. However, Jamison responded nonetheless and (_surprise!_) she wasn't a bot. She seemed to be legit. Now, as of yet, we still have not confirmed this interview, but that is beside the point. 

Today we received another brief message from her and I was caught off guard by her signature line.

_*consider all typos as proof that these emails are written by me, a human, and not by AI!_

Now, on the surface, I can get on board with the sentiment. I avoid intentionally using AI. I don't like it being forced on us in every aspect of our lives by our tech overlords in Silicon Valley. I regularly bemoan its usage in the creative arts whether graphics or writing or any other artistic endeavor. Not too mention the water and land consumption that is about to flood our country by way of data centers due to the current administration being intentional bedfellows with our tech overlords. None of this has a happy ending. So, yeah, the first thought in my head when I read the above was...well, honestly, "fuck ya!" 

However, shortly after my expletive of joy came the impenetrable thought of the human race battling AI through coerced linguistic demoralization. The badge of our humanity (on the internet at least) was potentially going to be driven by intentional crimes against grammar and spelling. Now, hear me, I am not saying that grammar and spelling are on the level of death and taxes when it comes to impassable cosmic laws. Cormac McCarthy spent a decent portion of his writing career intentionally forgetting how to use punctuation. I, for myself, love a good comma splice now and again. The difference lies in why I and, I presume, writers like McCarthy make these choices: it's to get an idea or image out there in the way that we as writers visualize it in our minds. We do it for the art. It is only great editors who show us our unintentional crimes against language. We don't do it as a rebellion against AI. We don't do it to prove our humanity.  We don't, for the sake of all that is good and holy, do it to be _authentic_.

Authenticity is one of those words that gets bandied about by the ~~interminably online snake-oil salesmen~~ thought leaders of our day. We must find ourselves, our true selves, to love with premium loofas and poorly paid online therapists. We are to be authentic in our humanity and, much like with Crossfit and Doonas, we all keep the loud part in our heads silent: "are you even authentic if you don't talk about it, bro?" I am convinced there is no authenticity in a world ruled by the hellish amalgamation of Caplitalism and technological accelerationism. Authenticity can only exist between people who have built some level of intimacy that is not mediated outside of typical human defenses (you know like those fig leaves in the garden?). Authenticity cannot be achieved through the mediation of the internet, or smartphone, or AI. 

The most concerning branch of my descent down this rabbit hole of an email signature was the thought that if this is in fact the direction we take in order to recognize whether something is _human_ or AI, then the linguistic structures we have nurtured **and** taken for granted will inevitably begin to shift in ways that we won't fully comprehend until we are two or three removes from it taking place. Our languages will be degraded in faux attempts at authenticity in online spaces. Substack-"a NeW eCoNoMiC eNgInE fOr CuLtUrE"-has become known by those who use it as the place where writers post their authentic selves without the gatekeeping of editors, grammar and spelling be damned. It has already been riddled with users who are clearly bots and users who filch the work of others through AI-generated content to get clicks and followers. And, yet, the response it seems is to double-down on shitty editing as a means of "being human," when what we need to do is to learn _again_ what joy there is in our <u>unstructured</u> play with language and its interplay with the <u>structured</u> joy of shaping what was made into something that reaches the human mind and the human heart. AI can do neither of these. AI only breaks down **content** into machine language and regurgitates it into a different order to avoid obvious charges of straight-up plagiarism. It cannot reflect on beauty. It cannot edit its own work. It is pure structured play and unstructured content creation with no joy or any other emotion to be found in it. 

We must realize that human language deserves better than this. A hundred monkeys randomly tapping on typewriters have a better shot at creating something moving and lovely because we know those monkeys had a hella good time banging away on those mechnical keys. In order to beat AI and rebel against it's decay of human creation, we mustn't pride ourselves in our inability to edit what we say and how we say it, but to learn, again, what the most powerful tool we humans have to build true authenticity and intimacy can do and the joy that can come from cultivating it. Otherwise we are just playing into the hands of our tech overlords and showing ourselves to be willing to *be* lesser than the dreaded content released from the vile 1s and 0s of artificial intelligence. No, friends, we need to once again find the aesthetic courage that has been passed down to us for millennia and by God we need to find joy in the midst of it.
