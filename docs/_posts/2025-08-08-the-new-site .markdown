__Hello!__ This is my new site utilizing Jekyll by way of Github. I had never done this kind of framework and I haven't touched command line work since I was in high school and built my own PC. Getting Jekyll installed and working towards learning and utilizing HTML to create this site is a significant task to accomplish for me. Excited to keep working towards understanding programming in order to make the place much more home-like.
